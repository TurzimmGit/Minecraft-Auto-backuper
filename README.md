🧭 Overview

Minecraft Auto-Backuper is a meta-language scripted tool designed to protect your large-scale Minecraft projects. It automates the entire cycle of data safety: identifying world folders, compressing them using solid WinRAR algorithms, mirroring the data to the cloud, and informing the user via email.

<details><summary><b>Why "Minecraft Auto-Backuper"?</b></summary>

For technical players, losing a world is losing months of work. This project exists to:

    Minimize Storage Impact: Uses WinRAR solid compression (-s) to reduce file size.

    Automate Cloud Redundancy: Integrates with Google Drive API v3 to replace old backups with fresh ones.

    Provide Peace of Mind: You don't need to check if it worked; the script sends the log directly to your email inbox.

    Local Hygiene: Automatically cleans up temporary .zip files and old logs to save disk space.

    Step 2: Each world is compressed into a .zip in background mode.

    Step 3: Files are uploaded to the "Backups_Minecraft_Vanilla" folder on Drive.

    Step 4: Local temporary backups are deleted.

    Step 5: The most recent log is sent via email and old logs are purged.
